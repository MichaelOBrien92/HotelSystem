# HotelSystem

The HotelSystem will be a simple yet complex integration of multiple systems required for a hotel to operate.

-BarSystem 
-RestaurantSystem 
-BookingSystem 

There will be two UI models:
1. AdminPanel, which controls all aspects of the system from prices, monitoring, creating new stock and adding employees.
2. WorkPanel, which allows the employees of the workplace, place orders, bookings, put a request for new stock.
